# Harvard Undergraduates for Inclusion in Economics Website
Harvard Undergraduates for Inclusion in Economics (HUIE) is a student-run organization at Harvard University dedicated to promoting diversity in economics. Our website is published at [https://harvarduie.github.io/huie/](harvarduie.github.io/huie) (or equivalently on my personal GitHub account at [https://cwang19.github.io/harvarduie/](cwang19.github.io/harvarduie)). 

As HUIE's Director of Technology, I created this website in January 2021 and will continue to maintain it throughout my time in the organization. The website is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Design credits for the site belong to [html5up.net](html5up.net). 

Please feel free to reach out with any questions!
